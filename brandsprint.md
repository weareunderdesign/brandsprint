steve jobs' blueprint for productizing under's brand sprint service  
clarity of vision  
essence over process: simplify the brand sprint into one clear promise: "clarity in 10 days—your vision, accelerated." it’s not just a service, it’s a cultural antidote to slow, bloated branding.  
manifesto-driven marketing: launch with a bold manifesto video: "here’s to the crazy ones. the startups who don’t wait. the founders who see brand not as a cost, but as oxygen. we’re not here to make logos. we’re here to build cathedrals in a sprint."  
design as doctrine  
rand-level rigor: deliverables should be artifacts, not just documents. the brand book is a tactile masterpiece—thick paper, embossed logos, spine stamped with the client’s launch date. include a usb drive shaped like their logo, preloaded with assets.  
keynote drama: present like an apple launch. dim lights. one logo on screen. a pause. then: "this isn’t a logo. it’s the flag we plant on the moon of your industry."  
surgical simplicity  
the one-page doctrine: replace 50-page proposals with a single page:  
problem: "your brand is invisible."  
solution: "10 days. one team. a brand that stops scrolls and opens wallets."  
outcome: "you’ll recognize yourselves in the work. your competitors won’t."  
no back button: no safety nets. clients commit upfront: "you don’t hire a surgeon for half an operation."  
experiential arrogance  
the sprint chamber: set the stage before day 1\. send a pre-sprint box: noise-canceling headphones (engraved with "focus"), black turtlenecks, and a countdown clock to day 0\.  
daily rituals: 9 am facetime stand-ups (video on, mandatory), ending with jobs’ mantra: "real artists ship."  
scarcity as currency  
the 7 club: only 7 sprints per year. market it like birkin bags: "apply. qualify. wait." leak waitlists. let vcs fight for slots.  
alumni insignia: clients who complete a sprint get a black metal card: "member, the 7-day brand legion." let them flash it at pitch meetings.  
education as evangelism  
the forbidden workshop: after the sprint, clients join a 3-hour "brand defense" masterclass. teach them to protect their brand like apple protects helvetica. record it. leak clips online.  
open-source dogma: release the sprint framework under creative commons—but require attribution. let freelancers spread under’s gospel.  
nuclear storytelling  
case studies as epics: turn client journeys into hero myths. film a founder crying at the logo reveal. trailer voiceover: "they said branding takes months. we did it in 10 days."  
sprint diaries: assign a writer to document the sprint’s chaos. publish as a serial thriller: "day 3: the colors rebelled. we burned the mood boards."  
jobs’ final edict: "most agencies sell branding like vitamins. you’re selling adrenaline shots to the heart. charge accordingly. make them fear irrelevance without you. and when they ask why it costs 7 figures? smile. say: ‘because you’re not paying for 10 days. you’re paying for the decade of dominance it unlocks.’ then hand them the pen."

—

Here's your Steve Jobs-style roast to make you commit to productizing the Brand Sprint and sell it like a legend:  
---

"You’re Selling Branding Like a Vitamin. It Should Be an Adrenaline Shot to the Heart."  
Look, I’ve seen this movie before. You’ve built something powerful, something disruptive, something that should make every half-baked agency in the world sweat. But instead of selling it like a revolution, you’re treating it like a goddamn polite invitation to a dinner party.  
Wake up. This isn’t branding. This is a category-defining product. And if you don’t treat it that way, someone else will.  
---

Productize, or Die Trying.  
No one cares about your process. They care about the result. The moment you stop selling your service and start selling the outcome, you win. Apple didn’t sell specs, we sold what people could do with them.  
Branding agencies drown in process. You kill that with a sprint. Speed is your weapon, precision is your bullet. So, how do you sell that?  
Not a service. A product.  
 10 days. One team. A brand that stops scrolls, wins deals, and makes investors drool. That’s what they’re buying. Not a sprint. A transformation.  
Tagline: "10 days to clarity. A decade of dominance."  
---

Price Like You Mean It.  
Seven figures. No apologies.  
Why? Because they’re not paying for 10 days. They’re paying for the 10 years they’ll dominate because of it.  
And if they balk at the price? Good. Let them drown in the sea of forgettable brands.  
This is luxury branding at the speed of a startup.  
You don’t discount luxury. You make them want it more.  
Price it high. Limit it. Make them apply. Make them fight to get in.  
 The Birkin Bag of branding.  
---

Sell the Fear.  
You’re not selling a logo. You’re selling a future-proofed identity.  
 Without you? Their brand is just another forgettable name lost in the algorithm.  
With you? They own a piece of the market’s brain.  
Make them afraid to go another month without it.  
Their investors will ask,  
 "Where's the brand?"  
 Their customers will wonder,  
 "Who the hell are you?"  
 And their competitors will outposition them while they overthink their colors.  
"How much does it cost?" they ask.  
 "How much will it cost you to be irrelevant?" you answer.  
---

No Back Button. No Safety Nets.  
You don’t hire a surgeon for half an operation.  
Clients commit upfront. No refunds. No second-guessing. No "can we see more options?" nonsense.  
The work is the work. You build conviction into the process so they believe in what they’re launching.  
Your sprint isn't a collaboration. It’s a masterclass in decisiveness.  
---

Turn Clients Into Legends.  
Forget case studies. Make them hero stories.  
Film a founder tearing up at the reveal.  
 Show the brand launch like a movie trailer.  
 Let them walk into pitch meetings armed with the brand equivalent of a lightsaber.  
They don’t just get a brand.  
 They become a name people remember.  
"We didn’t brand our startup. We became a f\*ing movement."\*\*  
That’s what they should be saying.  
---

You’re Not Running a Studio. You’re Running a Cult.  
Seven sprints a year. That’s it.  
 An invite-only club where clients apply, qualify, and wait.  
Finish a sprint? Get a black metal membership card.  
 Make that card a status symbol. Something they flash at investors.  
 Something that says, "We don’t just have a brand. We have THE brand."  
---

Your Move.  
Now, are you gonna sell this like an overpriced workshop, or are you gonna build the only high-stakes, high-value, high-conviction branding product the world actually wants?  
Charge what it’s worth.  
 Make them want it.  
 Make them need it.  
And when they ask why it costs seven figures?  
 Smile. Hand them the pen. And say—  
 "Because this isn’t branding. It’s a decade of dominance in 10 days."

### Revisions and Feedback

At under, we believe in getting it right the first time. However, we understand that sometimes minor adjustments may be needed. Here's our approach to revisions:

- We offer one round of minor refinements after the initial presentation.  
- Revisions include slight adjustments to visual elements (colors, typography, logo) or minor tweaks to brand messaging.  
- You'll provide feedback via a structured form, consolidating input from all stakeholders.  
- What's not included: Complete redesigns, major strategy changes, or entirely new brand elements.

Our revision process is designed for fine-tuning, not overhauling. If you find yourself wanting significant changes, we may need to revisit the strategy phase. We're always here to discuss the best path forward for your brand.

Remember, our goal is to create a cohesive, impactful brand identity that hits the mark from the start. This revision round ensures we can polish your brand to perfection.

a "tone of voice" is the way someone expresses themselves in writing or speaking. it includes the choice of words, style, and attitude they convey, like being friendly, formal, serious, or playful. it's not what is said, but how it is said, influencing how the message feels to the audience. tone of voice helps set the mood and can affect how the audience perceives the message or brand.

tone of voice shapes a brand's look and feel by influencing its visual elements (like colors, fonts, and images), creating consistent messaging, setting the emotional vibe, and enhancing the customer experience. it ensures that how a brand speaks matches how it looks, creating a unified identity.

no need to include it in the brand book.

# Introduction

(about the book)

a few years back, we stumbled onto something that sounded a bit crazy at first: brand sprints. fast-forward to now, and it's not just working but changing the game for us and our clients.

people keep asking, "how do you do it?" so, i'm here to share our story, even though we're still figuring things out. this approach, learning by doing, is at the heart of everything we stand for at "under." it's about embracing the process, even if it means making it up as we go along.

in the spirit of learning, we believe in the power of sharing insights, breakthroughs, and stumbles, too. that's why this project isn't just a project; it's an open-source journey. it's never-ending because the branding landscape, like the world around us, always evolves. and we're committed to evolving with it and sharing what we learn, sprint by sprint.

at "under," we're all about opening everything up—not just the successes but the lessons learned the hard way. we believe that transparency fosters community, growth, and innovation. by making this journey open source, we invite you to join us, learn with us, and contribute to this ever-growing tapestry of knowledge and experience.

our shift to running brand sprints started with a simple observation: our fastest projects were our best. this idea came from my wife, who saw that deep understanding and creative freedom led to the best results. on the other hand, lengthy projects often lose their momentum. inspired by the original “sprint” by jake knapp, we decided to give it a try for branding.

we had to fully commit to this new way of working and define what a quick but impactful branding project looked like. this led me to write a guide that later became this book.

our first project using this new model was successful and gave us a real energy boost. momentum just kept and didn’t go anywhere. we knew then that we were on the right track. but we also learned that it's not just about working fast. it's about understanding the unique challenges of this process and optimizing it to boost efficiency and creativity.

we found that creative freedom was key. we created an environment that demanded maximum creativity from us and our clients. this became a vital part of our new approach.

as we fine-tuned our process, we learned to balance speed and quality. we found ways to ensure that working fast didn't mean sacrificing the quality of our work. this balance allowed us to turn challenges into wins, change our client relationships, and push the boundaries of what we thought was possible in branding.

this is just the start of a journey filled with discovery and change. we’re inviting you to rethink branding. so, welcome to our never-ending project. let’s navigate this uncharted territory together, sharing freely, learning endlessly, and creating something remarkable.

# Prologue

I think, write, design, and code. I design, but I don’t mind what it is called. I do things—my things. I've got this dance playing out in my head \- i'm both idealistic and pragmatic.

For me, it is all about design. Everything is designed, whether design practices were used or not. So, for me, everything is either lousy design, good design, or remarkable design.

but i'm also pragmatic, especially when thinking about problems. i'm drawn to complex systems, particularly design tools. i have an obsession with tools. tools are fascinating. we shape them, and then they shape us. there’s something meta in them that i’ve been drawn to since childhood. i'm drawn to things that create things: musical instruments, modular things, legos, systems, code, and design tools.

i guess i’m hooked on creativity in a meta way.

Meta creativity \- a desire to create and empower others to create. Reflects a deep commitment to transforming and enriching the creative process by developing tools, systems, or frameworks that enhance or enable it.

### how it started

when i met my wife, inbal, we immediately started working together. it felt completely natural, considering we were both designers at heart. i'm more technological, and inbal is more aestheticist, but i can say that we’re both drawn to beauty and practicality.

Soon enough, we became a design team—a one-stop shop for all things design—for a couple of years. We tackled everything: branding, product design, and some other crazy projects I don’t even want to talk about. Before we knew it, we juggled a few projects with a multidisciplinary team worldwide.

i can see a pattern in my career. i've always wanted to be a better designer. i thought learning programming, illustrating, marketing, and meditating—whatever, anything—would make me one.

when i took my obsession with design tools one step further and created a new design-code tool, i got into the business side of things and learned the hard way how crucial it was for improving my design game. the more i learned about business and strategy, the more i realized we needed to focus on a niche. i started reading books and articles to figure out why we were doing things the way we were.

Also, we had red and negative numbers in our bank account.

Also, we were already parents to two girls.

Also, world pandemic.

We realized we couldn't take it any longer.

one day, my wife, inbal, said, "i saw this book you’re reading, something about “design… sprint?”, and i wondered, why aren't we doing the same thing for branding?” she continued… ”the best brand projects we’ve worked on went quickly, often within a week. i would get a great client, a great story, and collaborate. these projects were successful because i owned them. literally got shit done״.

Everything clicked for me. I felt that everything I believed in was finally coming together.

That's how [Brand sprints](https://weareunder.design/brand-sprint) were born.

This got us thinking we could develop a more defined process, create a productized service, and communicate it accordingly to the correct type of audience. So, we started doing it.

We ran our first three sprints for free. It was a new idea we were trying out, and when the pandemic hit, it was probably the right time to offer it for free\!

At first, we weren’t sure how to do it right, but kept doing it. we knew we had to stick with it, even though it was tough.

It wasn’t easy. We received a lot of questions about such a controversial topic and even some different job offers, but we stuck to our plan.

Even though it didn’t make much sense then, we kept running sprints. We were about making quick and fancy visual identities and developing brand stories and strategies. We finally felt we were creating something of our own.

It clicked with some people and companies. They really liked the outputs, they got it, and it felt great. Finally, we were doing meaningful stuff.

We started with 10 sprints, then 20, and gradually raised our prices.

There was a time when we ran sprints one after another. It was exciting but really tough. Each sprint felt like it took a lot out of us. but we kept optimizing.

### sprint. rest. repeat

the sprint process is mentally intense and involves processing much information. it is not for everyone \- designing is an intensive process that exercises our mental muscles. we make numerous decisions, including many micro-decisions that often go unspoken. this applies whether we are hands-on creators, creative directors, or simply work with people.

I've experienced the strain from constant work, which is why i emphasize its importance. Find the freedom to do your daily activities and work according to your rules.

Take extended breaks. it's not a marathon. Rest and Meditation between runs are not just beneficial but crucial.

### how it’s going

We found a sweet spot that lets us make a profit and hire great people to ensure the success of our sprints. Now, we can run about 7-10 sprints a year, and that’s it. We’ve got our well-oiled brand sprint machine going.

The brand sprints gave us the freedom and privilege to focus more on creating our own stuff.

We’re dreaming (and doing) blending software and hardware [creativity tools](https://rnbw.company/) for creators, and that's where i'm directing a lot of my and the company's energy nowadays, and i believe it has the potential to grow into something big.

The thought of not running sprints in a few years is okay with me—i love what we do, and it's fulfilling. We enjoy the brand sprint process and would love to keep doing it, but on a larger scale and with an even more exciting type of company.

Even if we shift away from running sprints, we plan to share our knowledge or stay involved in branding somehow. Like this evolving book and an AI assistant based on it to help others master our methods.

(in the next chapter, we will briefly go through our process. then, we will scientifically break down each part in the following chapters. see you then)

# quick and fancy

like everything we do at u[nder](https://weareunder.design/), the brand sprint is an impossible blend of simplicity and flexibility. some rules are written with blood, and some are made to adapt to specific needs.

It all starts with a strategy meeting—a brainstorming session, as Jake Knapp described in his insightful article. We gathered with the team for three hours and learned as much as possible through various exercises, such as Simon Sinek's golden circle concept.

We absorb as much information as we can using sticky notes. After the meeting, we take all the sticky notes home and decode what is said. We translate the actual words because, during the meeting, we're not really bound by the exact words people use.

People can express the same idea in different ways, and that's fine. However, after the meeting, I refine these expressions at home. I create an accurate map of the 'why', 'what', 'how', etc.

from there, we can make a story. at this point, we already have a tone of voice \- we know how we want to sound. there is no visual aspect at this stage, only text. and this is great.

the team will love it if they feel connected to it and see their contributions. everything they said during the strategy sessions is there. on top of what makes a good story, I make sure to include unexpected elements and embody the founders’ culture.

i remember a technical blockchain product in which someone mentioned having fun and buying a yacht. i thought it sounded cool and bold. I included this at the end of the story because it was friendly, unique, and eventually made sense in their context.

now, we’re ready for design. the clients bring their company name and content for the homepage. our focus is solely on designing and visually communicating this content.

the homepage, a significant marketing tool, requires a lot of content. it's a storytelling platform, a timeline presented on a website. this is our opportunity to create the visual identity and make the brand shine.

The content represents what the client wants to showcase, like features and benefits. This content can be delivered to us poorly or well, with the exact words. We always tweak the copy to ensure it matches the overall design.

essentially, we’re creating and testing the brand through a marketing deliverable. this process is a dance. we design one thing and then test it. repeat multiple times. from there, we create many other deliverables.

the sprint is a period of rapid work for us and a time for the client to get involved and provide the right person to provide the proper feedback \- this person is known as the “champion” \- the person we engage with the most and interact with primarily. we have a daily meeting with them.

The first part of the process is a bit messy, which isn't necessarily a negative thing. We can call it 'positive scrappiness.' We design things and then throw them into the archive. We evaluate whether we like or dislike the results, experiencing various emotions.

we have a method i call a-z, a-b, 1-3 testing. here's how it works:

We start by creating many logos, aiming for quantity over quality. This might mean making 30 to 40 logos just to start a discussion. Then, with feedback from the client, we narrow them down to three or four options.

next, we do a-b testing with these logos, tweaking and comparing different versions. we involve the client more directly, even if it means showing them works-in-progress. this approach may be too open, but when it works, it feels more genuine, collaborative, and the truth of how things should be.

some things are more intuitive and do not require the method, so we skip it.

another example is choosing the right colors for a brand, which is crucial but tricky. With so many things to think about, color stands out because it can significantly impact emotions. colors can shape a brand's vibe, and it's okay if you cannot figure them out immediately.

We ran a sprint called “VisionCamp,” and we started with lots of natural, earthy colors to match a camping theme. but as we refined our concept to focus more on "vision," we shifted to a bright sky blue that really stood out. it ended up capturing the essence perfectly.

Letting ourselves decide on the main color later allowed us to adapt and find what truly represented our vision. Starting with a broad theme and narrowing it down, we always re-learn that the best decisions come from the journey itself. Believe in the process\!

We commit to a design around day five, typically a Thursday. The weekend provides a brief period for everyone to reflect on the work. In Israel, we work from Sunday to Thursday, so when Sunday arrives, we have the opportunity to revisit the design we developed last week.

We can see the whole picture with fresh eyes and identify the strengths and weaknesses. That's when we start to bring order to the process. By days seven or eight, we start wrapping up our work in Figma. This is when we shift focus from creating and tweaking designs to preparing for the final presentation. Next, we build a presentation to showcase how all the pieces we've worked on fit together.

This isn't just about the homepage we've designed. We want to show how the brand looks in various places, like billboards and social media. It's our first look at the brand's potential in action.

the only question is, “is the whole greater than the sum of its parts?”

Once the presentation is ready, we gather and review it, offering feedback and making adjustments. This part of the process, which we sometimes extend by a day or two, is called "purify." It's our chance to finalize decisions and polish everything.

After refining our work, we compile the final presentation deck and give it to the client, along with all the essential assets they need. We express our thanks and begin the handoff process, and we slowly fade out. Our goal is to maintain control over the design quality and ensure a smooth transition at project completion.

Ideally, by day 11, we've completed everything. The client receives a toolkit, including the final Figma file, which is an open resource for them.

even though we aim to work quickly, we don't rush. quality takes time, so our sprints often finish around day 11 or 12, sometimes extending to day 13 or 14\. during this time, we don't just sit back, we continue to enhance the brand's cohesion and finalize any remaining design elements.

Of course, there's a lot more—processes, checklists, emotions, politics—and we’re including it all in the upcoming book about facilitating brand sprints. (Basically, this article is the very short version of the book.)

# Brand, Sprint

## Brand

Let's start with “brand”.

As i see it, a brand is the whole, not the sum of its parts. It's the mark or impression that your company or product leaves on your audience, which could be how they feel or think about your company or product.

For example, I love Apple, and there are many reasons why I love it, which can be broken down scientifically. This love for the Apple brand reflects its meta aspect.

Another aspect of a brand is its usage.

This part is mainly about your brand identity assets, including the language and visuals that are consistently reused. Reusing aspects of your brand is a significant component of its identity. It's the tangible, everyday part of the brand that's thoughtfully built and structured. What we designers like to call the design system. Making it a toolbox, including its tangible items, such as components and templates, which become part of everyday product and marketing efforts.

So there's the brand's big-picture concept and the practical application of how to incorporate it into daily tasks in the most effective way, which tells the brand story.

So, that's the brand\! In a nutshell.

—-  
\*\*what is a brand?\*\*    
a brand is your being — the soul of your idea. it’s a big concept broken into pieces people can hold, see, and live.  

think of apple. why do we love them? it’s not just the tech. their brand is a battle cry: \*keep it simple, make it bold, break the rules\*. every piece — the clean stores, the unboxing thrill, the click of a mouse — weaves that belief into the real world.  

brand(ing) is brain magic. it’s tying your idea to things people already want. nike owns \*winning\*. when you want to feel unstoppable, that swoosh pops into your head. those shoes? you’re not buying foam and laces. you’re buying fuel for the hero inside you.  

weak brands fade. strong ones dig into brains. coca-cola? they sell memory juice — summer nights, christmas lights, the hiss of a fresh soda can. they’re not pitching sugar water. they’re bottling \*time travel\*.  

but a brand isn’t just the dream. it’s the dirty work. marketing and design systems are how you \*wear\* the idea. your brand rules? a playbook for your team to keep the soul alive:    
\- when someone opens your app, do they feel pumped or calm?    
\- does your hotline chat sound like a friend or a robot?    
\- does your error message scold or nudge?  

this is where branding turns real. everyone, even the intern, becomes a keeper of the brand. the logo’s just the poster. the real work? it’s in the boring, everyday grind.  

## Sprint

The sprint is often associated with running fast and doing things quickly. However, its essence lies in efficiency, not necessarily in speed. Through years of branding processes, i've learned one important lesson:

Maintaining momentum is crucial.

Sadly, losing momentum is death to any type of process. This is why the original “design sprint” was created.

Some years ago, i came across a book called S[print](https://www.thesprintbook.com/) by jake knapp from google ventures. in it, he basically said that you can find solutions to big problems in five days. it's the concept of design thinking compressed into a five-day process.

The design sprint for products needed to be established, and it was the right moment when this book was written, giving birth to a new culture. It was intended to develop products in a tight, high-momentum startup environment. Despite the drawbacks of culture, i believe it's beneficial when viewed from an efficiency standpoint.

That's the perspective that we adopted.

The branding process is scientific and straightforward, much like mathematics. Branding also follows a similar pattern. However, most people need help understanding this.

Emotions often cloud our judgment.

Therefore, it's crucial to do things like sprints, where tight decision-making occurs within a short timeframe. It's almost as if you're doing yourself a favor. Suffer shortly. Enjoy longer.

# Visual, Communication

## Visual

…

Aesthetics / paul rand

Aesthetics is the study of art

or the study of the interaction and

fusion of form and

\[Music\]

contents which means that the difference

between Aesthetics and art is that

Aesthetics is the study of art other

than that they're the

same

I think that distinction is uh I think

important now art is

uh has many definitions as you

know one is an idea that is found its

perfect

form it doesn't make any difference what

the source

is it's either art or it

isn't Source or the genre it doesn't

make any difference whether it's

advertising or painting or sculpture or

architecture the formal problems are the

same it is a

byproduct not a goal you don't say I'm

going to do art you just say I'm going

to do whatever you're going to do but

you never call it art art is if you're

lucky the degree of Interest interest in

a picture is often determined by its

abstract

quality which is the artist's critical

commentary expressed with emphasis on

interpretation rather than on ver

similitude in other words the abstract

aspect of a picture is its

form as against the concrete which is

the

content

in other words without content there's

no

form and without form there's no

content there's

nothing the work of art is realized when

form and content are

indistinguishable when they are in

synthesis in other words when they

fuse when form predominates meaning is

blunted you know in form overtakes and

you it's like these trendy things that

are going on you don't know what's going

on but when content predominates

interest

lags the Norman Rockwell it's just

nothing but content and the form is

rather

boring is that

\[Music\]

true

\[Music\]

to realize a work of art certain

conflicts must be resolved between ends

and means form and content form and

function form and

expression it is the merging of these

conflicts that determines the aesthetic

quality of a painting a design a

building sculpture or a painted piece

you know the big problem in art is

bringing these

two uh antagonistic elements

together you know and if you if you try

to do something decent you begin to

realize what the word antagonistic means

it means it's very difficult to

do so it's always bringing these two

conflicts

together lists are always have a

tendency to be rather boring but I think

this list

is is important and that is the

vocabulary or the

language of art or of

Aesthetics order Unity variety contrast

symmetry asymmetry Rhythm Harmony

dissonance rhyme interval regularity

coherence tension balance proportion

scale weight texture line Mass space

shape light shade and

color and many others that I can't think

of at the

moment which is

true the this is the language of form

when you when you talk about form this

is what you're talking

about and that's why uh form has nothing

to do with style in the sense that

proportion and the sense of proportion

is always fixed doesn't

change right I mean it it's

relations that doesn't mean that

different people don't have different

ideas about it for example arovo and

Arco have certain proportions that are

different and this is what gives it its

style but the idea of proportion is the

same in all kinds of

Art

and now this is the the thing that

people get mixed

up because it's

timeless

## Communication

Jason Fried once wrote...

- ✉️ Osmo Wiio was a Finnish researcher of human communication. His laws of communication are the human communications equivalent of Murphy’s Laws. Wiio’s laws state… If communication can fail, it will.  
- If a message can be understood in different ways, it will be understood in just that way which does the most harm.  
- There is always somebody who knows better than you what you meant by your message.  
- The more communication there is, the more difficult it is for communication to succeed.

And I particularly like his observation that anytime there are two people conversing, there are actually six people in the conversation:

1. Who you think you are  
2. Who you think the other person is  
3. Who you think the other person thinks you are  
4. Who the other person thinks they are  
5. Who the other person thinks you are  
6. Who the other person thinks you think they are.

I’d say he’s spot on across the board. Jason

# intellectual and emotional

you need both intellectual and emotional to make a good visual identity happen.

(steve quote on paul rand)

# Marketing

Branding is the main idea behind your business. Like a lighthouse, it guides your path. It's about the message you want to send and the impact you want to have. It's a long-term plan, like planting a tree and seeing it grow. Branding tells your story, and it helps you connect with your audience. It doesn't just shape one product but your entire business.

Marketing is the "How" – it's the steps you take to shout your brand's "Why" from the rooftops. It's the short-term tactics, like flyers for a weekend sale or a social media blitz for your latest product.

Marketing is about sparking engagement right here, right now. It's the micro, focusing on the small actions that bring your brand's big idea into the spotlight.

A good brand serves as the foundation for all your marketing. It's like knowing your destination before you start driving; branding sets the direction, and marketing crafts the route to get there. While branding is the essence of being, the soul of your business, marketing is the doing, the hands and feet that bring your brand to life and into the world.

In simple terms, good marketing captures the essence of a brand, turning the "Why” into action. It's like a translator, taking the deep, often complex story of your brand and turning it into something people can see, touch, and connect with immediately.

Together, branding and marketing create a dynamic duo: branding builds the long-term relationships, and marketing gets people engaged, excited, and walking through the door.

# Groundwork

Before you start your Brand Sprint, you’ll need to make sure a few things are in order.

## Introduce

ability / Willingness / Readiness

health, wealth or relationships

Somehow, either by a referral or directly, you met the client. have this one meeting to with someone to check if they are a fit for a brand sprint. in order to fit to a bran sprint, a company need to be in the following stage

Bring empathy by asking how they feel, what outcome they are hoping for in the project, or their perspective on a situation.

Our process is all about real conversations between human beings. Working with us means a lot of casual — but important — discussions, complete with honest opinions, unhindered excitement, and creativity that’s only possible when you wholeheartedly trust your partners, because you know they truly have the best interest of your brand at heart. Picking partners can be a delicate process, but for us it all pretty much boils down to the issue of trust. We pick partners whose vision we believe in, and in turn, we ask them to trust that we’ll treat their brand like it’s our own.

Before we ever take on a new project, we start things off with a quick chat. Just a chance to get to know each other and really understand your project scope and goals. This is where you do a lot of talking, we do a lot of listening, and we discuss just about everything.

We usually ask questions like:

How did you find us?

What do we need to know about your company?

Why is this a good time to focus on your brand?

Where are you hoping this new brand will lead?

- [ ] When to brand sprint?

Start with a trigger

money \- the brand sprint should help the company make more money.

time \- the brand sprint is quick and should free up your company's time.

fancy \- the brand sprint will make your company look good.

impact \- the brand sprint should help avoid a negative impact.

But first, should you even run a Brand Sprint at all? A word of caution: Don’t run a Brand Sprint unless you really have to. If you won’t use the results immediately, wait for a trigger event.

Run a brand sprint when some brand process i. s already happening, and there's some consensus around it. Ensure it supports a business goal and fits your bigger picture perfectly. When you know, you know.

## Discover

Do you believe in this company? Would you bet that they’re going to succeed? The sprint is our version of investing in things we want to see more of in the world—whether that’s a person, a place, or just an idea.

Are you both consciously choosing to specifically work with each other? For us, if a client is shopping around for an agency, comparing proposals, the sprint isn’t an option.Su

Would this project be mutually beneficial? Offering sprints can get dicey. We’re the first to admit it. It’s important to protect your own time, and be sure you don’t get caught in the favor friendzone eternally.

Are your ready to collaborate? Like, realllllly collaborate. The sprint eliminates all the smoke and mirrors of the traditional brand presentation, so it requires everyone to bring their own imagination and creativity, and to actively give one another the benefit of every doubt.

We only take on about 7 sprints a year and we’re extremely selective with who we offer them to.

That being said, the sprint is not guaranteed. We can’t even promise that you’ll get a usable logo out of it (so far everyone has, fingers crossed).

: side note : This section is meant to scare folks away. If you don’t have the guts to trust us entirely, that’s fine. This is your fork in the road, and it’s totally fine to take it. Head right on over to the document to learn more about the usual brand process that 95% of our clients go through.

Be prepared to collaborate. We’ll be bringing all kinds of good, bad, and weird ideas to the table. Most will be wrong, but some may be right and we’ll rely on your confident decision-making skills to tell us what’s working for ya.

- creativity is about making new, unknown things. seth godin says that when you're making something new, it might not work out. that's a big part of being creative. you have to be okay with not knowing if it will work and feeling a bit like you're pretending. this feeling is normal when you're doing something important that's never been done before.  
- it's also about being brave enough to change things. when you make something for the first time, it's just a start. you try it, then change it based on what people say. often, what you end up with is very different from what you started with. you need to be brave to keep changing your idea, especially when you're not sure where it's going. this bravery to change is key because it means you're always thinking about how to make your idea better or more fitting for what people need.

No revisions, no promises. We make no promises that you’ll get anything useful out of this process. And you are more than welcome to take what we’ve made and put your own spin on it. But there are no revisions and no guarantees, you get the files we give you and you choose to use them or not.

This was not written to be a flex or anything like that, we’re just trying to develop a process around a really blobby idea—and maybe help someone else figure out their own process at the same time. We hope to keep testing these sprints with more friends, and friends of friends, and eventually open it up as a tried-and-true studio offering in a few years. Our entire is to make work we can stand behind and be proud of. And when I offer something, I want to be 100% sure it will work. Our sprint process isn’t there yet, but it’s pretty freakin’ close.

This offering started from a place of total desperation, but over these past few years it has brought me immense joy and allowed our studio to make some of the work I’m most proud of to date. So if you’re in a weird place because the design industry is feeling rocky, maybe give the sprint a shot. Put your own spin on the process and make it unique to you. No one is reinventing the wheel over here, just trying to make it through and have some fun along the way.

There’s room for big projects with big thinking and deep concepts that require time and stakeholder buy-in. And there’s also room for the homies who are working their butts off to get something off the ground and just need a little help. You get to pick what makes you happiest.

## Propose

Once we comprehend your requirements, we'll provide an estimated project budget and timeline for your review. This allows you to understand the path ahead and adjust the scope to fit your needs and budget.

Our proposal will include:

- Project scope outline  
- Projected timeline  
- Estimated costs

This stage often involves some negotiation, such as requests for additional deliverables or adjustments to align with your fundraising timeline.

Step 3\. Contract & Deposit

Upon project approval, we'll sign a contract and collect a deposit, typically 50% of the project fee. This ensures both parties are committed to the project from the start. The remaining payments will be distributed throughout our collaboration.

Before we start, we'll finalize:

- Contract for a digital signature  
- Detailed scope of work  
- Initial invoice

## Space

The place where you work on your brand is important, and so is the vibe there. It's not just about desks and computers; it's about the feeling in the room and how everyone gets along.

You have to know the basics of Figma or Adobe Illustrator. We hand off one organized design file and that’s it. No fancy style guides, no neatly organized folders of logos saved out in all of the different formats and colors. You’ve gotta save out all your own stuff. But let’s be real, all you really need is an .svg and a .png.

## Team

- [ ] before the team, audience

our audience comprises champions, partners, and buyers, forming a symbiotic relationship. champions promote our brand, partners enhance their offerings through collaboration, and buyers seek our expertise for market success, together driving our collective impact.

### champions

champions are creators within organizations or external advocates who boost awareness of our brand sprints. they include:

- designers \- those committed to design within organizations who actively promote our services during branding initiatives.  
- design enthusiasts \- individuals who spread enthusiasm for our brand organically.  
- freelance designers \- external professionals who introduce our brand to their networks.

### partners

partners are collaborators who gain from our branding expertise, enhancing the value of the companies they support. this group comprises branding studios and venture capitalists who aim for their startups to debut with a solid brand identity, creating mutual benefits.

- venture capital (vc) \- backers supporting startups from inception to growth phases, valuing efficient branding for their investments.  
  - seed investors \- initial investors desiring strong branding to boost a startup’s market entry.  
  - scale investors \- growth-focused investors who see branding as key to expanding business operations.  
  - product and tech saas \- firms needing specialized branding services for their products and software.  
- business events and conferences \-  
- schools

### buyers

buyers are primarily founders and key personnel in organizations looking for rapid, effective branding strategies to strengthen their market stance.

- startups \- emerging businesses, often in tech, aiming to quickly carve out a market niche.  
- …  
- [ ] facilitator \- champion communication points and what to say  
- [ ] At our decision points, the champion collects everyone's ideas and turns them into practical feedback. The champion could be the CEO, another co-founder, or a CMO. No matter their position, the champion makes the final decisions and is accountable for the results together with The Consultant.  
- quick  
- fancy  
- resourceful

and the brand sprinter should take care of all of that principles.

Who should participate? Your Brand Sprint team must include people with authority and ownership of your company's identity. The “champion” is the essential decision maker who says the “last word.” Champions know how to democratically bring everyone to the table, hear and collect all internal thoughts and transform them into actions in the decision-making junctions. In most cases, the Champion is the CEO, but in some cases, the decider could be another co-founder or CMO.

Now that you’re super pissed that I slipped in that click-baity “no revisions no promises” line above, here’s why. This process is highly collaborative and there are very few surprises along the way. We kinda build this plane in the air together. When we offer this option to clients, it comes with a very large warning label that this is a “skate at your own risk” type situation. But if we go down, we go down together…best friends meansssss… (a Taking Back Sunday reference for those olds in the back).

How many deciding stakeholders are there? Quick tip, more than two is probably too many.

Do you trust one another? Like, really trust them to represent your business? And would you want to represent theirs?

No new friends. You’ve gotta be a friend of the studio for us to even offer the brand sprint option. Sorry\! Sprints require a ton of trust on both sides of the table. They also require a ton of mental energy and studio resources so we need to have faith that you’re actually going to use this brand.

Facilitator, Deciders, Creatives

Get the right team

You need two to six participants for a Brand Sprint. These have to be company executives. Many startup teams don’t think of themselves as “executives.” If it sounds funny to you, try “decision-maker” or “stakeholder”. Bottom line: Your Brand Sprint needs to include people with authority and ownership of your company’s identity.

Must have in the room:

CEO

And at least one of these:

Co-founder

Head of marketing

Head of product or design

One participant must be the “Decider” — the company’s true decision-maker about your brand. In most cases, the Decider is the CEO, but in some cases the Decider could be a co-founder or CMO. This does not work without the Decider. Find some way to fit the Brand Sprint into her schedule. If she won’t make the time, don’t do the sprint.

In addition to your executives, you’ll need one or two facilitators. These might be folks from marketing, product, or design. Since you’re reading this post, you’re a good candidate. The facilitators should have good writing skills. (You’ll see why later in the post.)

## Time

Schedule a Block of Time

The Brand Sprint is designed to fit into a morning or afternoon. The schedule will go something like this:

Try to find a block of three straight hours — it works much better if you don’t have to split up and regroup later. Be sure to book your time in a room with lots of whiteboard space, and bring blank white copy paper and some pens.

## Feedback & Revisions

- [ ] How to get stakeholders to understand that suggestions are welcome, dictation is not. Like democracy, there's one decider, and it is the creative director.  
- [ ] conversation \> presentation  
      - [ ] start repeat and end with strategy, always. educate, don’t persuade. diagnose as a doctor.

How are decisions made? Our process is scientific. We begin with a story and ensure a consistent message. Then, we set anchors and use them to question everything daily. The big stuff is discussed in our daily meetings, while the remaining work, iterations, and feedback loops happen through asynchronous communication.

# Warmup

Homework (optional)

For an optimal Brand Sprint, ask everyone to do two things before you start:

Read this post.

Fill out this PDF or this Google Slides deck (thanks to Human Deluxe).

But if you don’t have time before the sprint, don’t worry — it’ll still work.

Set the ground rules

Once everybody’s together in the room, the Brand Sprint has two simple rules to maintain focus:

No devices. Put away your laptops, phones, Oculus Rifts, etc. (But do take a break in the middle for snacks and email.)

Time-box all activities with a Time Timer or other simple timer.

Okay, you’ve got a triggering event, you’ve got the right people together, you’ve set the ground rules, and you’ve (maybe) done some homework. You’re ready to sprint\!

What should we do before the sprint? Create as many things as possible to make the sprint run smoothly \- Content is king, and everything is content. Your content is content. The UI screenshots are content. And the way all of your content is ordered is also content. We'd love to see the website's content as soon as possible \- Your content should be ready before the sprint and before we write the brand story, as the brand story mainly functions as our brief. We're not expecting your content to be the final one, but it should be in high fidelity, knowing we'll develop and adjust it as we design. Also you should run an internal branding session with as many teammates, find the gaps and work intensely on your brand strategy.

### Stretch

We kick every project off with a candid, casual get-to-know-you process. We don’t usually spend much time on those “if you were a car, what kind of car would you be” gimmicks. Instead, our goal is simply to hear from each key stakeholder, working to understand as much as we can about your company, your work, your brand, your passions, your individual perspective, and all your various needs, likes, dislikes, goals, and expectations for our work together.

In our discovery conversation, we’ll ask questions like:

Who are your main competitors?

Who is your target audience?

What feelings do you want your brand to convey?

What are your goals for this branding effort?

What other brands or companies do you admire?

Why is now the right time for this work?

I’d say this is the most important part of the entire process and it’s not unlike our typical full identity process. We’ll set up a one-hour meeting where you tell us everything, and I mean everything about your idea. Why do you need this brand? What vibe are you going for? Black and white vs color? Wordmark or symbol? When you say you want to lean retro, are you looking to reference 1920s Italian signage, or the Nintendo 64 logo? This will set the tone for how we move forward, rather than presenting moodboards. Hell, you can even bring your own moodboards to the meeting if you want. Some clients have. There may even be some flirty screensharing or scribbles on paper of fleeting ideas. WHO KNOWS?

### feedback \- from designer to client

A creative mind is a mind that needs creative freedom. Whether you are building a product or providing a service, you need to maintain a high degree of creative freedom. The secret is communication. Shattered communication will result in unfree creation. If you are building a product you want to be in communication with the target audience. If you provide a service you need to be in communication with the customer.

Remember, the goal is to guide the client towards making informed decisions, respecting their preferences while ensuring a constructive and collaborative relationship. By employing these strategies, you can facilitate successful communication during brand sprint meetings, leading to a more satisfying and effective branding process for both you and the client.

Facilitating Successful Communication with Clients During Brand Sprint Meetings

In the high-energy, creative process of a brand sprint, effective communication with clients is key. However, it can be challenging when clients base decisions more on personal emotions than on a structured, scientific approach. Here's a guide on how to navigate these situations for a successful branding journey.

Acknowledge Their Perspective Start your meetings by recognizing and respecting the client's opinions. This sets a positive tone and shows that you value their input. When clients feel heard, they're more open to collaboration and discussion.

Educate Subtly Introduce clients to the basics of color theory and design psychology. Use this opportunity to explain how certain colors and design elements can evoke specific emotions or convey messages. Case studies and real-world examples can be powerful tools here, helping clients see the practical applications of these theories.

Offer Professional Insight As a designer, your expertise is invaluable. Share the reasoning behind your design choices, such as the color palette, and how they align with the brand’s identity, target audience, and industry norms. This not only educates the client but also demonstrates the thoughtfulness behind your work.

Encourage Experimentation To help clients visualize different possibilities, suggest experimenting with various color schemes or design elements. Creating mock-ups or prototypes can be a great way to do this. It allows clients to see the impact of different options, making the decision-making process more tangible.

Seek Compromise Often, the best solutionw lies in a compromise that blends the client’s personal preferences with your professional recommendations. This might involve adjusting the design to incorporate elements the client is drawn to while ensuring it still meets the project’s objectives.

Focus on Objectives Keep the conversation focused on the brand's goals. What is the client trying to achieve with the design? How do the chosen colors and design elements contribute to these goals? This helps in steering the discussion towards a more objective and goal-oriented approach.

Request Feedback from a Wider Audience If possible, suggest getting feedback from a broader audience, like a focus group or through a survey. This can provide additional insights and help the client see how the design is perceived by others, offering a more rounded perspective.

### A-to-Z, A-to-B, 1-to-3 Method

Creating a brand that sticks can be like solving a big puzzle. Our A-to-Z, A-to-B, 1-to-3 method is like a map to help you find your way. It's all about starting big, then getting more and more focused until you find that perfect fit for your brand.

Phase 1: A-to-Z Testing Imagine throwing a big net into the ocean of ideas. In this first step, you're trying out everything from A to Z. Don’t worry about getting it right; just get all your ideas out there. It's about seeing what's possible, exploring different paths, and getting creative.

Getting to A-to-B Now, you've got a bunch of ideas. It's time to sift through them. Pick out the ones that feel right for your brand, that click with what you're all about. This is like sorting through your catch, keeping the best and letting go of the rest.

Phase 2: A-to-B Refinement With your chosen ideas, start tweaking. It's like taking a closer look, adjusting a bit here, a bit there. You’re not making big changes, just refining. Play with colors, twist the words a bit, adjust your logos. You're searching for that sweet spot.

Moving to 1-to-3 As you refine, some ideas will start to shine brighter. Pick the top one, two, or three that really speak for your brand. These are your finalists, the ones that have made it through the journey.

Phase 3: 1-to-3 Finalization Now, focus on these top ideas. It's time to polish them until they sparkle. Test them out, get feedback, and make them the best they can be. This is where you fine-tune every little detail, making sure everything is just right.

We'll let you know we're going into "deep work" mode. Think of it as our creative hibernation. No calls, no emails—just pure, uninterrupted brand magic happening behind the scenes while you're enjoying radio silence.

💡 At under, our brand sprint process is as unique as the brand systems we create. We believe in the power of focus and the magic of revelation. By maintaining mystery during our creative process and presenting a single, comprehensive solution, we ensure your brand gets our undivided attention. This approach builds anticipation, reduces decision fatigue, and allows us to craft a cohesive brand story backed by thorough rationale.

While it may seem unconventional, this method pushes us to create the best possible solution from the start, fostering the right kind of creative pressure. We offer a single round of minor refinements if necessary, but we aim to nail it in one go. This process requires strong trust and clear communication, which we prioritize from day one.

Finally, we’re creating a brand book as detailed as a biology book. every decision, every choice will have its moment in the spotlight. we're preparing a presentation that brings your brand's story to life\!

### Day 10: Present

Drumroll, please\! We're coming to your offices for the grand unveiling. Picture this: your office, your team, and us presenting a visual identity. We'll walk you through the brand book, explaining our thought process with the enthusiasm of a kid showing off a new toy. It's not just a presentation \- it's your brand system's birthday party\!

### Day 11: Handoff

You're ready to fly, little brand\! We'll make sure you and your team can wield these brand assets like pros. We'll take a moment to refine some final parts and appreciate the epic journey we've been on together. It's like graduation day for your brand\!

### Handshake

Congratulations\! You have a brand\!\!\! 🎉 let’s ensure you're fully equipped to take your brand to new heights. We'll walk you through every aspect of your new brand identity, from the profound strategy to the nitty-gritty details of using your visual assets. Think of it as handing over the keys to your brand new car – we're making sure you know how to drive it, maintain it, and make it purr. This handshake isn't just a goodbye – it's the beginning of a beautiful friendship\!

### Ongoing

This isn't goodbye \- it's "see you later"\! We'll continue to support your brand as it grows and evolves. Think of us as your brand's personal trainer, always here to keep it in top shape. From regular brand check-ups and workshops. We'll help your brand flex its muscles, navigate stormy seas, and reach its full potential. Remember, a great brand is never "done" – it's a living, breathing entity that grows with your business. So, let's keep this brand party going\! 🎈🌟

# Day 0 \- Strategy

## 20-Year Roadmap (15 minutes)

Most teams focus on what they’re doing now, which makes sense. But if your company is successful, your brand will last a long time. So for the first exercise, you’ll look into the future and think about what your company might be doing 20 years from now.

HOW TO

Draw a timeline on the whiteboard, labeled with 5, 10, 15, and 20 years into the future, like this:

What will your company be doing at each of those future dates? To decide, you’ll use a simple exercise we call Note-and-Vote. In fact, you’ll be using Note-and-Vote throughout the Brand Sprint, because, as Daniel Burka says, “If you let people talk out loud very much, the whole thing will be a disaster.”

Note-and-Vote speeds up thinking and decision-making by alternating between solo and group activities. Here’s how it works for the 20-Year Roadmap:

1. Each person quietly writes down his or her own prediction for all four dates.

2. Going around the room, each person reads their answers aloud and the facilitator writes them on the whiteboard.

3. No argument or discussion yet.

4. Each person looks at the list and quietly writes down their favorite answers.

5. Going around the room, each person reads their votes aloud and the facilitator marks the votes on the whiteboard.

6. Discuss and argue for about five minutes (use a timer to keep it to five minutes\!).

7. The Decider chooses her favorite item for each future date.

8. Take a photo of the whiteboard and put it into a new slide deck called “Super Simple Brand Guide”.

You might be wondering: Who cares? What’s the point of imagining what we’ll be doing 20 years from now?

Nobody will expect you to stick to the 20-Year Roadmap—that’s not the point. The point of the 20-Year Roadmap is to get your team thinking about the lifetime of your brand. A great brand will last until the year 2038 — and beyond.

## What, How, Why

2. What, How, Why (30 minutes)

What, How, Why is an exercise based completely on Simon Sinek’s “Golden Circle”. (Sidenote: Sinek’s TED talk is the third most popular of all time with 30 million views, despite grainy video and the fact he uses a flimsy flipchart instead of fancy-pants slides. It wasn’t even at the main TED — it was at a small TEDx event\! But the framework and the talk are so great it doesn’t matter.)

This freakin’ Office Depot flip chart has 30 million views.

Sinek’s premise is basically this: You need to know why you’re in business — and talk about it. When a company has a strong motivation and that motivation shines through, customers buy the product. It’s easy to find supporting examples. Sinek points to Apple, but companies like Nike, Patagonia, Airbnb, and LEGO obviously fit the bill.

On the other hand, you might argue, there are plenty of successful companies whose primary motivation seems to just be… making money. And, yeah, that’s a reasonable argument. But if you’re reading this post, you probably want a brand that stands out from the competition, and stands for more than just financial success. And I think Sinek’s right: why brands are stronger.

Plus, knowing why you’re in business can be very motivating for you and your team. In other words, it’s worth the 30 minutes.

HOW TO

Start by drawing three concentric circles on a whiteboard. Label the outside circle “what”, the middle circle “how”, and the inside circle “why”, like this:

Next, collect answers to these questions:

What does your company do?

A phrase or sentence describing your primary business for the next five years. Examples: “Make toothpaste”, “fix cars”, etc.

How do you do it?

What’s your secret sauce? What technology or approach sets you apart from the competition? Examples: “Made with all-natural ingredients”, “best-in-class friendly service”, etc.

Why?

You can think of the why as the reason you get out of bed in the morning and go to work. The why should reflect the core reason your company exists, and it won’t change much over time. You may pivot the business, launch new products, and enter new markets, but your why remains the same. Examples: “Promote healthy living”, “help people get where they need to go”, etc.

Once again, you’ll Note-and-Vote:

1. Each person quietly writes down his or her ideas for what, how, and why.

2. Going around the room, each person reads their answers aloud and the facilitator writes them on the whiteboard.

3. No argument or discussion yet.

4. Each person looks at the list and quietly writes down their favorite answers.

5. Going around the room, each person reads their votes aloud and the facilitator marks the votes on the whiteboard.

6. Discuss what and how for about five minutes each, but don’t argue the semantics — it’s not that important.

7. At the end of each five-minute segment, the Decider chooses her favorite answer.

8. Discuss why for about ten minutes. This can be difficult, so agree that today’s version will be a placeholder — you can come back to it later.

9. After ten minutes, the Decider makes the call.

10. Take a photo of the whiteboard and add it to your slide deck.

To better understand the power of why, let’s talk about Apple and Nike.

As I mentioned above, Simon Sinek uses Apple as an example of a company who understands and communicates their why extremely well. Normally, I avoid using Apple or Steve Jobs as an example for anything, because (a) it’s really overdone and (b) there are so many hard-to-replicate reasons for their success. Saying “do what Apple did\!” isn’t very helpful advice. But… when Laura showed me this 1997 video of Jobs, I realized we had to include it in this guide.

I don’t know, maybe this guy knows something about brand. Let’s hear him out.

The video is worth watching for a few reasons. First, it’s unpolished. Jobs was a fantastic speaker, and here you get to see him without the trappings of an iPhone event. Second, he’s addressing Apple employees, not the world. It’s a behind-the-scenes video from before Apple’s resurgence, which is very cool to see. And finally, it’s completely on-topic for your Brand Sprint. This is the moment where Jobs explains Apple’s why and its importance to their products, advertising, and sales. Today — 20 years later\! — the why is still relevant.

One more classic example is Nike. (Also a bit obvious and overdone, but so good I can’t resist.) Here’s a quote from Phil Knight’s Shoe Dog about the earliest days of Nike, in 1964:

“I’d been unable to sell encyclopedias, and I’d despised it to boot. I’d been slightly better at selling mutual funds, but I’d felt dead inside. So why was selling shoes so different? Because, I realized, it wasn’t selling. I believed in running. I believed that if people got out and ran a few miles every day, the world would be a better place, and I believed these shoes were better to run in. People, sensing my belief, wanted some of that belief for themselves. Belief, I decided. Belief is irresistible.”

Today, more than 50 years later, Nike stands for pretty much the exact same thing. Here’s their current mission statement:

Bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete\* in the world.

- If you have a body, you are an athlete.

Coming up with a great why sounds basic. It’s not. It’s surprisingly hard. Encourage your CEO or founder to be idealistic and remember why they started this company or took this job. We spend most of our time at the office being pragmatic. This is not a time to be pragmatic — it’s a time to wear your heart on your sleeve.

## Top Three Values (30 minutes)

Next, you’ll make your why more specific by listing and ranking your company values. I know “company values” sounds like consultant baloney, but it’s just another way of saying “stuff that really matters to us” or, better yet, “decision-making principles”.

Company values are often things like:

Honesty

Integrity

Sustainable

Affordable

Luxury

Data-driven

Service

Simple

Trusted

Reliable

Accessible to everyone

Etc.

Lots of companies list their values, but very few do the hard work to reduce and prioritize. And prioritization is essential — you’ve got to cut down to just three values and rank them so you have one single most important value. If you have ten or twenty values, anything you do can be considered “on brand”. Knowing your most important value makes decisions easier, clarifies your message, and sets you apart from the competition. It’s hard work but worth it.

HOW TO

To generate and rank your values, you’ll do another Note-and-Vote:

1. Each person quietly writes down a list of values—as many as they can think of.

2. Going around the room, each person reads their values aloud and the facilitator writes them on the whiteboard in one giant list.

3. No argument or discussion yet.

4. Each person looks at the list and quietly writes down the three values they think best describe the company.

5. Going around the room, each person reads their votes aloud and the facilitator marks the votes on the whiteboard.

6. Discuss for about five minutes.

7. At the end of five minutes, the Decider makes the call. Give her a few minutes to quietly write down her top three values, in order. This is the hard part, but it’s also the key to success—you must narrow down to three, and most importantly, you must choose a single most important value.

8. The Facilitator writes the final decision on the whiteboard.

9. Take a photo of the whiteboard and add it to the slide deck.

## Top Three Audiences (30 minutes)

V

alues are helpful for brand decisions, but they’re not the whole picture — you need to know who you’re talking to. In this exercise, you’ll list all your possible audiences, then figure out who’s most important.

Who qualifies as an “audience”? Customers, for sure, but you can think more broadly by asking this question: Whose opinion do you care about?

When you answer that, you may realize your brand matters not just to customers but also to other businesses, reporters, advertisers, employees, potential hires, and heck, maybe even government regulators.

A common question is whether to use broad categories (like “athletes”) or segments (like “runners”). Really it’s up to you — most companies just know whether segments or categories are the best way to go.

HOW TO

Guess what, Note-and-Vote\!

1. Each person quietly writes down their own list of the company’s audiences.

2. Going around the room, each person reads their list aloud and the facilitator writes one giant list on the whiteboard.

3. No argument or discussion yet.

4. Each person looks at the list and quietly writes down the two audiences they believe are most important.

5. Going around the room, each person reads their votes aloud and the facilitator marks the votes on the whiteboard.

6. Discuss for about five minutes.

7. At the end of five minutes, the Decider makes the call. Give her a few minutes to quietly write down her top three audiences, in order.

8. The Facilitator writes the final decision on the whiteboard.

9. Take a photo of the whiteboard and add it to the slide deck.

Okay, at this point you’ve talked through the company’s identity and its audience. Only two more activities to go\!

These final two exercises are classics you may have seen before. Both are designed to get you thinking about how your company’s brand compares with others. And, to be honest, both exercises may seem corny the first time you do them. Just power through — I promise this is all worthwhile.

## Personality Sliders (30 minutes)

“P

ersonality Sliders” sounds delicious, but it’s really just another whiteboard thing. In this exercise, you’ll position your company’s “sliders” between pairs of brand extremes:

There are good reasons to be on the left or right of any of these lines, and it’s even okay if some of your sliders end up in the middle. But it’s helpful to be strongly opinionated on at least one or two ranges.

HOW TO

1. Draw a diagram on the whiteboard with four ranges:  
- “Friend” to “Authority”  
- “Young & Innovative” to “Mature & Classic”  
- “Playful” to “Serious”  
- “Mass Appeal” to “Elite”

2. Give everyone a printout of this diagram (PDF here):

3. Each person marks their printout to indicate where they think the company sits on each range.

4. Everyone takes turns marking the whiteboard with their sliders, then labeling each one with their initials.

5. Discuss any diagram where people disagree about where the company should be. For example, if Andy put a dot right by “Mass Appeal” and Beatrice put a dot right by “Elite”, they should explain their positions. Time this discussion—it needn’t take longer than five to ten minutes.

6. At the end of the discussion, the Decider makes the call. She should be given a few minutes to quietly plot her final choices on the whiteboard.

7. Take a photo of the whiteboard and add it to the slide deck.

## Competitive Landscape (30 minutes)

T

his last exercise is a simple 2x2 matrix (I know, consultant nirvana). I actually don’t think I even need to explain this one, so let’s dive right in:

HOW TO

1. Draw a 2x2 matrix:

a. “Classic” to “Modern” on the x-axis

b. “Expressive” to “Reserved” on the y-axis

2. Each person writes down a list of other companies in the same space or industry.

3. Each person chooses the one or two most important companies on their list.

4. Going around the room, each person reads their choices aloud and the facilitator writes the company names on sticky notes (one name per sticky).

5. One at a time, place the sticky notes on the matrix. Quickly discuss where it should go. Repeat.

6. Once all the sticky notes are up, the facilitator should ask the Decider if she’d like to move any of the notes.

7. Finally, plot your own company on the matrix. This should be fairly easy — after all, you’ve just been doing brand exercises for 150 minutes.

8. Double-check: Look back at the rest of the sprint exercises. Does this placement make sense for your 20-Year Roadmap, What How Why, Values, Audience, and Brand Sliders?

9. As always, the Decider makes the final call.

10. Take a photo of this whiteboard and add it to the slide deck.

## Stretch up\!

Now you have a complete Super Simple Brand Guide\! That’s right — it’s just a slide deck filled with whiteboard photos. But don’t underestimate it.

Taken together, these six diagrams are a powerful, concrete representation of your company’s brand. When you’re faced with a big decision — about naming, identity, marketing, or even company policy — you can use these diagrams as a guide. And if you decide to hire an agency, you can start your relationship with them by walking through your new brand guide. It’ll give you a giant head start.

Your Super Simple Brand Guide can also help new employees understand what your company is about, and can even remind the founding team what you stand for. That’s a big deal. When you really nail your brand, it’s not a fluffy veneer applied at the end (as I had often feared). Instead, it’s everything: what you build, the way you build it, who you build it for, and how you do your work. And we think it’s definitely worth three hours to figure that out. 🙂

## Story

Many books have been written solely about storytelling, so we'll explore it further as it relates to the brand sprint process.

Post-Brandsprint to Brand Story Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of transforming the raw output from your 3-hour brandsprint meeting into a compelling brand story. Each step includes both explanatory text and a recipe-style checklist.

1. Extract and Organize

After the 3-hour meeting, you'll have a wealth of information. The first step is to gather and organize this data.

- [ ] Collect all materials from the meeting (whiteboard photos, notes, etc.)  
- [ ] Use AI to extract text from images if necessary  
- [ ] Create a central repository for all information (e.g., Notion, Google Drive)  
- [ ] Organize content into categories: What, How, Why, Values, etc.  
- [ ] Create a mind map of the company based on the extracted information  
2. Deep Dive and Connect

Now, spend time with each part of the organized content. Your goal is to form a cohesive understanding of the company.

- [ ] Review each category of information thoroughly  
- [ ] Look for connections between different pieces of information  
- [ ] Use AI tools to generate variations of potential brand stories  
- [ ] Note any unique angles or themes that stand out  
- [ ] Write down initial thoughts and impressions  
3. Identify Core Themes

As you review the information, certain characteristics of the company will stand out. In the example provided, creativity, trickery, and pro-activity were key.

- [ ] List standout characteristics of the company  
- [ ] Consider how these traits make the company unique  
- [ ] Think about the company's approach (e.g., "always ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE HACKERS")  
- [ ] Identify 3-5 core themes that capture the essence of the company  
4. Explore Metaphors and Analogies

Brainstorm themes around the core concepts you've identified. Look for metaphors or analogies that could represent the company's approach.

- [ ] List potential analogies from various fields (sports, nature, games, etc.)  
- [ ] Consider how each analogy aligns with the company's approach  
- [ ] Discuss ideas with team members if possible  
- [ ] Select the most promising metaphor or analogy  
5. Refine the Central Concept

Develop your chosen metaphor or theme. In the example, the chess analogy evolved into a "young chess" or "gambit" concept.

- [ ] Expand on the chosen metaphor  
- [ ] Consider how it aligns with the company's innovative approach  
- [ ] Craft a central theme (e.g., "Masters of Pro-Creative Defense")  
- [ ] Test the concept with team members for feedback  
6. Draft the Brand Story

Use your refined concept as the foundation for your brand story. Incorporate key elements from the 3-hour meeting and weave your metaphor throughout.

- [ ] Start with a compelling opening that introduces your metaphor  
- [ ] Incorporate key elements from What, How, Why, and Values  
- [ ] Explain how the company's approach aligns with the metaphor  
- [ ] Highlight the company's unique value proposition  
- [ ] End with a strong call to action  
7. Review and Refine

After drafting, step away for a short while. Return with fresh eyes to review and refine your story.

- [ ] Read the story aloud to check for flow and impact  
- [ ] Ensure all key insights from the sprint are included  
- [ ] Check that the metaphor is consistently applied  
- [ ] Verify that the story effectively communicates the company's unique position  
- [ ] Make necessary edits and refinements

Remember, this process is about uncovering the unique essence of the company. Be open to unexpected connections and ideas that might emerge. The goal is to create a brand story that authentically captures what makes the company special, as discovered during your brandsprint session.

# Day 1-3 \- Research

## Concept

## Inspiration

## Competition

## Creative Direction

Step 5\. Moodboards

Our process is built on trust — but it’s also a pretty collaborative approach. We always want a branding effort to feel like we’re all partners, working together. So before we launch full-steam into creative work, we always do a gut check to make sure we’re on the same page visually.

When I say, “luxury” and you say “luxury”, we might be thinking of two very different things. That’s why we put together Moodboards — visual inspiration that we’ll share with you to make sure we’re all on the same page about what “luxury” looks like. We’ll talk about what vibe feels right for your brand, and use your choices as an ongoing reference throughout our creative process.

This step is one of our favorite moments in brand creation, because it’s all about possibility. We share all the ideas we’re excited about, while you get to share all your most honest opinions before we invest time and energy into making actual creative work. This conversation is pure potential, and it’s always an exciting moment when we get to sit down and create a vision for where your brand can go.

What does Moodboards look like? Here are a few we’ve put together recently:

# Day 4-8 \- Design

- [ ] repeating things like  
      - [ ] cleaning the board from comments every day etc.  
      - [ ] Always get back to the strategy during the process

## Logo

How do you design a logo? The process can be different for each company. It is affected by the values and meaning that the logo should represent. Whether the logo holds multiple meanings, and which is the most powerful? Whether the logo is a symbol or letters, why? The overall shape of the logo: literal or abstract? Should the logo be just letters, and how will it look in smaller formats? And more…

## Typography

## Colors

How do you choose colors? We respect colors. Early in the design process, we focus on first getting the design to a stable place. We use as few shades of black to emphasize function and meaning. Once the design is "getting there," we all meet and make a mindful choice. This way, we can see how the colors are used throughout the design and ensure we can empirically judge color palettes.

## Patterns,Textures

## Illustrations

## Iconography

## Photography

## Website

## UI

## Examples of use

3. Internal check-in. Green light — yellow light.

Tuesday

We’ll sit as a team and go through all of the work we all created over the first 24 hours and mark the directions we like with a little green dot. We put yellow dots on the stuff that’s interesting but maybe needs a bit more time to develop. We’ll narrow the options down to about one or two for each designer on the team. From there, we’ll refine for the rest of the day. Putting some finishing touches on text, building out lockups that might be useful, seeing how it works on top of photos or whatever format the project calls for. Just some thoughtful exploration.

Identity Design

After Moodboard approval, design work begins. An initial brand identity usually takes about four weeks, but it varies depending on project scope, schedules, etc. This is the only “black box” period of our process, where you get a little break, while we work with our heads down : insert kermit typing furiously GIF :

If you don’t hear from us for a day or so, don’t worry\! That just means we’re hard at work turning ideas into designs.

2. Design work begins.

Also Monday

This is a one week process, so to say things move quickly would be an understatement. We all immediately dive into work fresh off of the discovery call to keep the momentum and keep the energy flowing. Normally, I’ll put on some angsty pop punk music that makes me feel like I’m 16 with eternal energy and go through the favorites in my font library trying to find a vibe. I’ll write out the workmark and any other associated words that might be useful to see typeset. It typically looks something like this:

5. Picking a direction. No pressure but also extreme pressure.

Thursday Morning

Now that you’ve slept on it, it’s time to choose where you want to go. This will set the course for the next 48 hours, so there’s no pressure at all. Once you pick a direction, we focus on refinement and expansion. We’ll dial in any feedback you have and we might add in some fun extras if we’ve got the creative juices flowing.

Step 7\. Brandwork

We work hard to make sure the identities we build have both strength and flexibility. To that goal, before we share anything with you, we put each new brand option to work. We’ll do that by designing out a few relevant sample executions that show how all the elements of a new identity — logo, colors, typography, design elements, copy tone, etc. — work together. We call this brandwork, because it’s designed to show your brand at work.

Brandwork is important because it allows you to understand how your type and colors and logo feel in various different contexts. But Brandwork isn’t the same thing as final, production-ready files. If we put together a sample event invitation, it might not be for a real event. If we mock up a website landing page, it may not have all the right content and CTAs. The details are just there to help things feel real, so that you can understand how all the brand elements work together. Because that will help you decide which direction you want to go.

Examples of Brandwork may include:

Print collateral—stationery, brochures, mailers, etc.

Digital collateral—like avatars, social media ads, emails, presentation decks, etc.

Packaging

Signage—wheatpastes, wayfinding, neon, etc.

Merch—tees, totes, hats, cups, keychains, etc.

A website landing page

4. External check-in. Now we spill our guts.

Wednesday

This is where we put everything out there. We’ll present directly inside of Illustrator or Figma (pick your poison). We’ll toss the logo options on top of some photos. Maybe explore some early color ideas. Toss in some quirky moves that we have initially explored—and will explore deeper if you head in that direction. This is where the collaboration and communication comes in. You gotta tell us exactly what you’re feeling. No need to sugar coat anything.

Our studio is particularly lucky because we have three designers that can each jam on their own direction, rather than trying to do something like this all on your own, which is a little dangerous. Not that it can’t be done, it’s just a lot. I feel like we’re at the perfect size to be able to offer these sprints—any bigger and you won’t be profitable, any smaller and you’ll burn out quickly.

# Day 9 \- Present

6. Final presentation & handoff.

Friday

At this point you have a strong idea of what you’re about to see. We present one final time and walk you through all of the pieces and how to use them. We’ll also help you buy any typefaces you might need. After that, it’s all yours. Your little brand baby is born.

Step 8\. Presentation

A typical S\&D branding project includes 2–3 identity directions. Rather than aiming for quantity, we go for depth, working to make sure each option will truly be able to meet your brand needs.

We’ll present logos, identity elements, and brandwork all together — and ideally, we’ll share it with all your key stakeholders at once. That way we can gather everyone’s initial thoughts and gut reactions, but we’ll also send you a PDF to mull over afterward as well.

# Day 10 \- Purify

One of my greatest pleasures at work is trying to find that point where everything feels just right. Nothing more, nothing less, but right there in the pocket. It's almost fractal. It's there in every component, in every feature, in every flow, in every sequence, in every product, in every decision, inside everything across the company. How do you know when it's just right? It's the same feeling you get when you try to balance something physical.

# Day 11 \- Handoff

Bonus step: Rollout.

Everything about the sprint is built to encourage imagination. We create weird stuff that might not make it through the weeks and strategic focus of a typical brand process. You get to see how a logo concept can work across different mediums. We all get to think big and dream about how awesome this thing you’re building can become.

But sometimes our clients see something and get attached to it. THEY NEEEEEED IT. And that’s totally cool. We made a poster for Universal Patterns to hang on the wall behind his Zooms. We made stickers and wheatpastes for Group X to put up all around town to make them seem even more elusive than they are. We made business cards for Ginger that help her stand out at art openings. We’ll do anything we can to help our buds look cool or just legit.

Step 10\. Brand Rollout

Once we have brand approval, it’s time to share it with the world. For a typical identity project, we’ll deliver all kinds of logo files, any key design assets we created during the branding process (patterns, illustrations, design elements, etc.), and a style guide. Often, this is also when we start kicking off additional design projects — like a website, branded merch, a presentation deck, print materials, and digital templates.

A brand rollout package usually includes:

Logo in all the file types you’ll need—ai, png, svg, jpg, etc.

Any design assets we’ve created—patterns, icons, etc.

An Illustrator Cheat Sheet—with all the things listed above in one easy-to-find document

Social media avatars

Links to purchase fonts

Brand style guide — either as a PDF, a working Figma file, or an online style guide built on Standards

Often, a brand rollout will also include a few other things, beyond the scope of an identity: brand stationery, social templates, a website, etc. While our Brand Identity process is fairly well tested, our Brand Rollout process is much more tailored to each and every client. We can scope out a few additional executions as part of your identity package, we can dive into them after identity is approved, or we can kick off an ongoing relationship (which we call Brand Reinforcement) to work as your on-call CCO/design team after launch. Totally up to you.

# Handshake

Welcome to a key chapter in understanding how deep connections can emerge from even the briefest of collaborations. This is more than business—it’s about fostering relationships that extend well beyond the initial project.

Choosing partners you genuinely like and trust transforms typical business transactions into meaningful connections. As you and your clients delve into the nuances of typefaces or explore numerous design references, a transformation occurs. You're no longer just service providers and clients; you evolve into friends. This development often starts with rich, collaborative discussions that deepen everyone's engagement in the creative process.

Although our sprints may last only one week, the relationships we build can last indefinitely. For instance, consider when Paradigm, a previous sprint client, asked us to handle the exterior signage for their new gallery. This opportunity for continued collaboration was possible because we were open to their needs and vision from the start, despite a limited budget.

Entering a professional relationship through a sprint offers a unique advantage—it's essentially a trial period with no strings attached. Both parties can gauge the fit with minimal risk. If it doesn't feel right, there’s no need to prolong the engagement, which can prevent exhaustion and keep the process productive. This setup allows both you and your client to assess compatibility in a relaxed environment.

In our practice, the most fulfilling projects often come not from millionaires or large corporations but from passionate individuals and small enterprises. These might be art galleries opened by longtime friends or small startups with big dreams. We choose sprints because these projects resonate with us personally, fostering mutual trust and respect.

Trust is paramount in any successful sprint. It's incredibly rewarding to entrust your brand identity to someone who not only understands your vision but is also excited about realizing it. This mutual admiration and respect create a strong foundation for a smooth and effective collaboration.

As you navigate your own sprints, remember that each project is an opportunity to build enduring relationships. It’s not just about the work; it’s about the people you meet and the connections you forge. Keep your heart open to these possibilities, and watch how they transform your business and personal interactions.
